# TwitterWhack

Simple Sinatra web app that allows users to play a Twitter version of the Googlewhack game (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlewhack). The user provides two search terms, and the application sends requests to Twitter’s API to search for recent tweets containing those words. Calculates the user’s score and displays a sample tweet that contains their search terms.
